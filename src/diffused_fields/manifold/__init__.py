Geometric structures and manifold operations.

This module contains the core geometric data structures:
- Manifold: Base geometric manifold class
- Pointcloud: Point cloud data structure and operations
- Mesh: Triangle mesh data structure and operations  
- Grid: Grid utilities and voxel operations

Dependencies: numpy, scipy, open3d, potpourri3d
