# Diffused Fields

This package is supplementary material for the paper **"Object-centric Task Representation and Transfer using Diffused Orientation Fields"**.

This is the **core package** that provides fundamental diffusion algorithms and geometric manifold operations for computing **Diffused Orienation Fields (DOF)**.

For robot manipulation experiments using **DOF**, see the companion package:
- **[diffused_fields_robotics](https://github.com/idiap/diffused_fields_robotics)** (depends on this package) - Object-centric robot manipulation applications: local action primitives (peeling, slicing and tactile coverage), trajectory optimization, and reinforcement learning using DOF.

## Features

**Core package for solving orientation valued diffusion PDE (i.e., heat equation) on geometric manifolds.**

This package provides implementations of both traditional diffusion solvers and walk-on-spheres methods on point clouds for various data types (scalars, vectors, quaternions).

- **Diffusion on Manifolds**: Scalar, vector, and quaternion diffusion on point clouds 
- **Walk-on-Spheres Methods**: Monte Carlo-based diffusion solvers for point clouds and various geometric primitives
- **Visualization Tools**: Interactive 3D visualization with Polyscope
- **Comparisons to Baselines**: Comparison to nearest frame projection, tangent vector projection and Euclidean diffusion baselines

## Installation

### Complete Installation (Recommended) 

Follow the installation instructions of the **[diffused_fields_robotics](https://github.com/idiap/diffused_fields_robotics)**

### Stand-alone Installation Using Python 3.12 virtual environment
